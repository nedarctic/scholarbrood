                                        Refunds at ScholarBrood are not automatic and are considered on a case-by-case basis. Due to the customized and intellectual nature of academic writing, research support, and publication processing services, once work has commenced, resources, time, and expertise are immediately invested. As such, refunds are only issued under specific conditions outlined in this policy.

                                        ScholarBrood prioritizes resolving client concerns through revisions, clarifications, and reasonable adjustments before considering any refund. A refund will only be evaluated after the client has allowed adequate opportunity for the issue to be corrected in line with the original project instructions.
